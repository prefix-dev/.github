## prefix.dev – blazing fast package management

At [`prefix.dev`](https://prefix.dev) we are commited to a great developer experience, fast and reproducible software environments and speedy software package management that gets you and your colleagues ready to develop right away!

We are the people behind the succesful [`mamba`](https://github.com/mamba-org) package manager. Mamba handles packages for Python, C, C++, Fortran, Ruby and many more programming languages – at prefix.dev we are commited to expand that.

Some key features:

- `mamba` works fully cross-platform – we support Linux, macOS and Windows and WebAssembly natively.
- We ship _binary_ packages that are pre-compiled for maximum installation speed
- Packages are downloaded and decompressed in parallel
- To get started - [**read our docs**](https://prefix.dev/docs)

We collaborate with the open source [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org) package distribution that ships many tens of thousands of software packages for data science, machine learning. You can browse all available packages on our fuzzy search on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev)! If you are missing a package, do not hesitate to reach out to us [via email](mailto:hi@prefix.dev) and we can help.
